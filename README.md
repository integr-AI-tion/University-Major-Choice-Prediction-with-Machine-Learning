I made a survey for my school's final year project to better understand students' intended university major based on their interests, activities, and influences. 
This project was made with the intention of knowing whether students' university major choices can be predicted from their survey responses.

I collected survey data and applied basic data science and machine learning steps, including data inspection and cleaning, feature encoding, train-test splitting, model training, and evaluation using confusion matrix.

Through this project, I also just learned that the reason my model got a low accuracy score was due to the extremely small dataset size with only 44 survey responses, and the class imbalance there is.
